Guidelines:

    Refactor the above stack implementation, using the concept of closure, such that there is noway to access items array outside of createStack() function scope.

    The candidate should be able to refactor the code and get the desired output.

    The candidate should be able to explain the code why it was not working before.

    The candidate should be able to explain the code why it is working now.

Initialize the stack (i.e., items[]) with the let keyword, as let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used. Use proper methods for push and pop operations of the stack. Print the stack for each time when you call push() and pop() so that the elements present in the stack will display.

The output of this problem is "Count is 0â€œ. 

As we initialize the function call of createIncrement(), the counter is set to 0. So when we call the increment(), the value of the count is incremented but not going to print because in the log() we initialize the counter set to 0. 

Closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access their outer scope. Closure helps in binding a function to its outer boundary and is created automatically whenever a function is created. A block is also treated as a scope since ES6. Since JavaScript is event-driven so closures are useful, as it helps to maintain the state between events.

Encapsulation can be defined as "the packing of data and functions into one component". Packing, which is also known as bundling, grouping and binding, simply means to bring together data and the methods which operate on data. The component can be a function, a class or an object.
